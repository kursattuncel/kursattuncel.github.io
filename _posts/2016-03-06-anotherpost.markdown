# My First Blog Post Here

This is my first blog post. I'll be writing about something here.

* Apples
* Bananas
* Oranges

These are the 3 things I like.

```
# this is a comment

function()
{
	javascript.function.here
}

```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
